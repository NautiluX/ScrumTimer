# ScrumTimer

This project is a timer for scrum daily standups.
Based on team size and needs the timer can be configured from 1 to 99 seconds. The current time left is shown on a 2 digit 7 SEG display.
To start or stop the timer, a touch module can be pressed.
The logic is implemented for Arduino.
Arduino Nano is suitable for this project, the 3D printing models (soon to come) are also designed for the size of an Arduino Nano.
